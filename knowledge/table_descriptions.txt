Table: level_units
Description: This table contains information about building levels and what they contain. Each row records the number of 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom, and 3-bedroom type apartments, the total number of units, the number of residents on that level, and the associated activity space.
Columns: bedroom1, bedroom2, bedroom3, units, residents, open_space
bedroom1: Number of 1-bedroom apartments on the level
bedroom2: Number of 2-bedroom apartments on the level
bedroom3: Number of 3-bedroom apartments on the level
units: Total number of apartment units on the level
residents: Total number of residents living on the level
activtiy_space: ID of the associated activity space (links to the activity_space table)
Example rows:
bedroom1: 23, bedroom2: 29, bedroom3: 4, units: 56, residents: 130, activtiy_space: 24
bedroom1: 18, bedroom2: 22, bedroom3: 1, units: 41, residents: 89, activtiy_space: 13
bedroom1: 18, bedroom2: 14, bedroom3: 1, units: 33, residents: 65, activtiy_space: 7
bedroom1: 8, bedroom2: 14, bedroom3: 1, units: 23, residents: 55, activtiy_space: 7
Typical use: Analyze the distribution of apartment types and residents per building level, and determine which activity space is associated with each level for planning and management purposes.

Table: activity_space
Description: This table contains all activity spaces with their geometrical and environmental information as columns. Each row represents a unique activity space, including its spatial properties, environmental conditions, and possible activities. The most important columns are level (which level the activity space is on), area, and activity. The activity column lists one or more possible activities for that space.
Columns: key, type, orientation, height, area, level, open_side, in_out, wind_exp, utci, neigh_dist, usability, green_suitability, compactness, types touching, neighbours touching, bounding area ratio, core distance, cos(angle_in_radians), sin(angle_in_radians), edge count, longest edge length, privacy score, activity
Column meanings:
key: Unique identifier for the activity space, activity space is outdoor space, the keys goes like O1,O2,O3...
type: type of open space, based on area (e.g. balcony, terrace)
orientation: Cardinal direction (e.g., N, SW, SE)
height: Height of the space (meters)
area: Area of the space (square meters)
level: Building level/floor where the space is located
open_side: Number of open sides
in_out: Indicates if the space is indoor or outdoor
wind_exp: Wind exposure
utci: Universal Thermal Climate Index
neigh_dist: Distance to nearest neighbor
usability: Usability of the space (e.g., warm_sunny, cool_breezy, comfortable)
green_suitability: Suitability for greenery (e.g., suitable, not_suitable)
compactness: Compactness ratio
types touching: Number of different types of spaces touching
neighbours touching: Number of neighboring spaces touching
bounding area ratio: Ratio of bounding area
core distance: Distance to building core
cos(angle_in_radians): Cosine of orientation angle
sin(angle_in_radians): Sine of orientation angle
edge count: Number of edges
longest edge length: Length of the longest edge
privacy score: Privacy score (0â€“1)
activity: Possible activities in the space (e.g., Flexible Space, Creative Corridor, Sitting, Sunbath, Healing Garden, Sports, Urban Agriculture Garden, Storage & Technical Space, Biodiversity balcony, Viewpoint, etc.)
Example rows:
key: O1, type: balcony, orientation: N, height: 3, area: 18, level: 1, open_side: 1, in_out: outdoor, ..., activity: Flexible Space
key: O3, type: balcony, orientation: SE, height: 3, area: 27, level: 1, open_side: 2, in_out: outdoor, ..., activity: Sitting, Sunbath, Healing Garden, Sports, Flexible Space, Urban Agriculture Garden
key: O28, type: terrace, orientation: SW, height: 3, area: 216, level: 2, open_side: 2, in_out: outdoor, ..., activity: Urban Agriculture Garden
Typical use: Analyze the spatial and environmental characteristics of activity spaces, determine which activities are possible in each space, and support planning or assignment of activities based on space properties.

Columns: resident_key, resident_persona, level, age, tenant/owner
resident_key: Unique identifier for each apartment in the building.
resident_persona: The type of persons or demographic of the household (e.g., gardeners, young_professionals, night_owls, expats, creatives, etc.).
resident_population: Number of people living in household (1, 3 or 5 people).
level: Level/floor of the household in the building.
age: Average age of people living in household.
